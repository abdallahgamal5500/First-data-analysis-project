# First-data-analysis-project
This was my first data analysis project. I did it to train my self on discovering the data relations and to get some useful insights from it.
The dataset info: Investigating Dataset contains information about 10k+ movies collected from TMDb.
The dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/juzershakir/tmdb-movies-dataset.
After the analysis steps I found that: 
1-The modern movies are more popular than the old movies.
2-The modern movies have voters more than the old movies. 
3-The old movies have a higher rating points than the modern movies. 
4-The old movies have a higher net profit percentage particularly between 1970 to 1980 more than the modern movies.
5-After comparing the number of the successful movies and the failed movies, I saw that the number of the successful movies are approximately equal to 2.5 times the number of the failed movies (4:1).
6-The old movies were longer than the modern movies. Especially between (1960:1970).
7-The comparison between the failed and the successful movies runtime for each year shows us many result like: the failed movies between (1960-1980) was longer than the average runtime for the successful movies, but after 1980 the failed movies runtime was shorter than the successful movies average runtime (120 min).
